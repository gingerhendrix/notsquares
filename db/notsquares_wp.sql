It&#8217;s rated really high in the Ideas forum!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what I think, all the decisions get made by an elite crime-fighting squad funded by an anonymous millionaire. Er, I mean the four core devs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These sentiments, and others like them, are the focus of today&#8217;s post. Setting aside the similarities between Ryan, Andrew, Mark and Peter to Charlie&#8217;s Angels for a moment, the question of how decisions about features are made needs to be addressed. There are a number of mechanisms in place for communication between the community and the core team, but with so many different channels, it&#8217;s hard to keep up with them all and still focus on production. Here&#8217;s where we are now&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>#wordpress-dev IRC channel</strong>: The IRC channel used to be more active. These days there&#8217;s rarely more than a dozen or two people online at any given time, and hours go by with no activity. When a question pops up, it&#8217;s often a tech question from a less experienced developer or site manager looking for help, as opposed to ongoing discussions about the best way to approach core code and features. When core-focused discussions do occur, they tend to fade out as time zone variances cause people to log off before a core dev enters the room.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/\">wp-hackers list</a>:</strong> The hackers mailing list reaches thousands of contributing developers, plugin developers, and lurking interested parties. Discussions range from how to use hooks to whether or not something in core should be changed to troubleshooting for other list members. Conversations on this list sometimes can get heated and occasionally stray into rudeness, which makes some people hesitate to utilize this communication channel.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development\">This dev blog</a>:</strong> This blog is used mostly for &#8220;official&#8221; announcements, and more recently, for surveys and polls intended to give the core devs an idea of community opinion on things being considered for future versions. Posting is irregular, sometimes with new content every other day, sometimes with nothing for a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/\">wpdevel.wordpress.com</a>:</strong> Another blog, also an &#8220;official&#8221; outlet, in which the core team posts about any big code changes they&#8217;re working on. This gives plugin authors and contributing developers a heads-up, and provides a place for community discussion around specific issues like the new widgets API.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org\">Trac</a>: </strong>The ticket system used for active development has gotten out of control. Hundreds of tickets are already lined up for future versions because they were punted from current releases; many aren&#8217;t even relevant anymore. Trac has wound being a place where people report bugs, suggest code changes, request features and debate methodologies; some of these conversations are years old. This broad use of the system makes it harder to power through tickets and get bugs fixed.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/\">Ideas forum</a>:</strong> The Ideas forum is a place where anyone can suggest a new feature, rate features suggested by others, leave comments, and generally discuss the future of the WordPress application. However, like Trac, some of the items here are years old. Because of the way the rating system works, older items remain at the top of the list. Some threads are simply he said/she said preference arguments, as opposed to contructive discussions about the value of implementing certain features or changes. There&#8217;s no direct connection between the Ideas forum and Trac.</p>\n<p>WordPress is an open source project, successful because of the community that both develops and uses it. At the same time, some people find it difficult to become involved in the project, and are unsure of how to engage with the core team and community at large. The channels listed above can be overwhleming to someone just joining the community, and/or frustrating to longtime community members who feel like they used to have more influence. We need to fix this. The WordPress project needs to be welcoming, easy to navigate as a contributor, and provide useful feedback to help grow the expertise of its community members.</p>\n<p>I think we should figure this out together. You, members of this community, know how you feel about the communication channels available to you. You probably have ideas about how to make it better. Some of you may even have sketched out digrams of systems that you think would work better.  Link Ideas to Trac? Change the Ideas rating algorithm? Close Trac tickets that don&#8217;t get resolved within a certain period of time? Just do everything through Trac? What do you think? What would make it easier for you to keep up with development progress and get involved with the varius contribution opportunities? I *know* you have an opinion.</p>\n<p>Over the next few weeks, we&#8217;ll be gathering your input about how we can improve communication and participation, and then we&#8217;ll embark on a project to fix/create a system for collecting ideas, opinions and feedback that will allow WordPress to grow as an inclusive community. Here&#8217;s the plan: Gather ideas from people via IRC, forums, live chats, surveys, etc. Assemble a small group of interested parties to help figure out possible approaches, put suggested approaches to a community vote. If redesigning something (like the Ideas forum) is deemed necessary, utilize community designers to create layouts. Beta test it to see if it does work as hoped. Launch and make everyone happy with the new, improved communication/ideas/feedback system!</p>\n<p><strong>Up First</strong></p>\n<p>Use <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/269201\">this forum thread</a> to post your suggestions about this. What do you think needs to be changed or improved? How would you structure it? How do the existing channels fit into your suggestion?</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, May 12 at 21:00 UTC (5pm New York time), hop into the #wordpress-dev IRC channel (irc.freenode.com) and talk about your suggestions for how to improve communication. I&#8217;ll be there, taking notes and answering questions, and asking follow-up questions when someone pitches a good idea. An hour later, I&#8217;ll be joining the <a href=\"http://wordcastpodcast.com/\">WordCast Podcast</a> to talk about this issue. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">They&#8217;re trying to set up a call-in format; if that pans out, we&#8217;ll post the call-in info in the dev channel. Otherwise, </span> A call-in number has been set up through TalkShoe.</p>\n<p>1-724-444-7444<br />\nMeeting ID: 50127<br />\nPin (if you don&#8217;t have a TalkShoe account): enter 1#</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll also read off suggestions being made in the dev channel and discuss them.</p>\n<p>More opportunities to weigh in on this issue to come.

It&#8217;s rated really high in the Ideas forum!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what I think, all the decisions get made by an elite crime-fighting squad funded by an anonymous millionaire. Er, I mean the four core devs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These sentiments, and others like them, are the focus of today&#8217;s post. Setting aside the similarities between Ryan, Andrew, Mark and Peter to Charlie&#8217;s Angels for a moment, the question of how decisions about features are made needs to be addressed. There are a number of mechanisms in place for communication between the community and the core team, but with so many different channels, it&#8217;s hard to keep up with them all and still focus on production. Here&#8217;s where we are now&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>#wordpress-dev IRC channel</strong>: The IRC channel used to be more active. These days there&#8217;s rarely more than a dozen or two people online at any given time, and hours go by with no activity. When a question pops up, it&#8217;s often a tech question from a less experienced developer or site manager looking for help, as opposed to ongoing discussions about the best way to approach core code and features. When core-focused discussions do occur, they tend to fade out as time zone variances cause people to log off before a core dev enters the room.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/\">wp-hackers list</a>:</strong> The hackers mailing list reaches thousands of contributing developers, plugin developers, and lurking interested parties. Discussions range from how to use hooks to whether or not something in core should be changed to troubleshooting for other list members. Conversations on this list sometimes can get heated and occasionally stray into rudeness, which makes some people hesitate to utilize this communication channel.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development\">This dev blog</a>:</strong> This blog is used mostly for &#8220;official&#8221; announcements, and more recently, for surveys and polls intended to give the core devs an idea of community opinion on things being considered for future versions. Posting is irregular, sometimes with new content every other day, sometimes with nothing for a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/\">wpdevel.wordpress.com</a>:</strong> Another blog, also an &#8220;official&#8221; outlet, in which the core team posts about any big code changes they&#8217;re working on. This gives plugin authors and contributing developers a heads-up, and provides a place for community discussion around specific issues like the new widgets API.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org\">Trac</a>: </strong>The ticket system used for active development has gotten out of control. Hundreds of tickets are already lined up for future versions because they were punted from current releases; many aren&#8217;t even relevant anymore. Trac has wound being a place where people report bugs, suggest code changes, request features and debate methodologies; some of these conversations are years old. This broad use of the system makes it harder to power through tickets and get bugs fixed.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/\">Ideas forum</a>:</strong> The Ideas forum is a place where anyone can suggest a new feature, rate features suggested by others, leave comments, and generally discuss the future of the WordPress application. However, like Trac, some of the items here are years old. Because of the way the rating system works, older items remain at the top of the list. Some threads are simply he said/she said preference arguments, as opposed to contructive discussions about the value of implementing certain features or changes. There&#8217;s no direct connection between the Ideas forum and Trac.</p>\n<p>WordPress is an open source project, successful because of the community that both develops and uses it. At the same time, some people find it difficult to become involved in the project, and are unsure of how to engage with the core team and community at large. The channels listed above can be overwhleming to someone just joining the community, and/or frustrating to longtime community members who feel like they used to have more influence. We need to fix this. The WordPress project needs to be welcoming, easy to navigate as a contributor, and provide useful feedback to help grow the expertise of its community members.</p>\n<p>I think we should figure this out together. You, members of this community, know how you feel about the communication channels available to you. You probably have ideas about how to make it better. Some of you may even have sketched out digrams of systems that you think would work better.  Link Ideas to Trac? Change the Ideas rating algorithm? Close Trac tickets that don&#8217;t get resolved within a certain period of time? Just do everything through Trac? What do you think? What would make it easier for you to keep up with development progress and get involved with the varius contribution opportunities? I *know* you have an opinion.</p>\n<p>Over the next few weeks, we&#8217;ll be gathering your input about how we can improve communication and participation, and then we&#8217;ll embark on a project to fix/create a system for collecting ideas, opinions and feedback that will allow WordPress to grow as an inclusive community. Here&#8217;s the plan: Gather ideas from people via IRC, forums, live chats, surveys, etc. Assemble a small group of interested parties to help figure out possible approaches, put suggested approaches to a community vote. If redesigning something (like the Ideas forum) is deemed necessary, utilize community designers to create layouts. Beta test it to see if it does work as hoped. Launch and make everyone happy with the new, improved communication/ideas/feedback system!</p>\n<p><strong>Up First</strong></p>\n<p>Use <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/269201\">this forum thread</a> to post your suggestions about this. What do you think needs to be changed or improved? How would you structure it? How do the existing channels fit into your suggestion?</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, May 12 at 21:00 UTC (5pm New York time), hop into the #wordpress-dev IRC channel (irc.freenode.com) and talk about your suggestions for how to improve communication. I&#8217;ll be there, taking notes and answering questions, and asking follow-up questions when someone pitches a good idea. An hour later, I&#8217;ll be joining the <a href=\"http://wordcastpodcast.com/\">WordCast Podcast</a> to talk about this issue. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">They&#8217;re trying to set up a call-in format; if that pans out, we&#8217;ll post the call-in info in the dev channel. Otherwise, </span> A call-in number has been set up through TalkShoe.</p>\n<p>1-724-444-7444<br />\nMeeting ID: 50127<br />\nPin (if you don&#8217;t have a TalkShoe account): enter 1#</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll also read off suggestions being made in the dev channel and discuss them.</p>\n<p>More opportunities to weigh in on this issue to come. Also, further investigation into the similarities between the core devs and Charlie&#8217;s Angels. <img src=\'http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\' alt=\':)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' /> </p>\n\";}i:6;a:13:{s:5:\"title\";s:54:\"Contributing to WordPress, Part III: Usability Testing\";s:4:\"link\";s:54:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/05/testing-opps/\";s:8:\"comments\";s:63:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/05/testing-opps/#comments\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Mon, 04 May 2009 13:57:13 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:10:\"Jane Wells\";}s:8:\"category\";s:25:\"DevelopmentUser Interface\";s:4:\"guid\";s:39:\"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=724\";s:11:\"description\";s:336:\"One of the reasons WordPress 2.7 was such a success is the amount of usability testing that took place during the development cycle.

First, determine the scope of your test and create a test protocol/script. Determine the audience segments to be included in the test group(s), and begin recruiting. Recruiting may mean hiring an agency to find participants, but for testing WordPress, it makes more sense to recruit from within this community, so that means making a screening survey, reading all the responses, segmenting the respondents into categories and contacting people until you&#8217;ve filled your desired quotas (for whatever segments you&#8217;re seeking, such as newbie, experienced user, developer, CMS user, photoblogger, mobile user, etc. ). Then come the test sessions.</p>\n<p>Depending on what is being tested, these last anywhere from half an hour to an hour and half apiece. Sessions are generally recorded using screen capture and web cam, with a video camera for backup. The moderator(s) generally take notes during sessions and/or (depending on what software is being used for the session capture) set markers in the video to indicate task completion, comments of interest, etc.  In some cases, auxiliary test methods such as eye-tracking may be included. When the sessions are complete, the results are analyzed. All the notes and videos are reviewed, patterns are identified, and ultimately a report is written and the feedback informs the next round of revisions.</p>\n<p>Some people think it shouldn&#8217;t take much time to do all this. I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of people who cite <a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html\">an old article by Jakob Nielsen</a> that says you don&#8217;t need to test with more than 5 users because usability issues become clear right away. While I&#8217;ve found that to be generally true, when your user base is as diverse in experience level, usage, platform  configuration, language (right to left languages have a pretty different experience) and demography as the WordPress community is, 5 users really isn&#8217;t enough to get a clear picture. We try to test with at least a dozen people each round, but then we are limited to a geographic region (test in NY, test in SF, or test wherever we can schedule enough people back to back to make it worthwhile), while WordPress users are located all over the globe.</p>\n<p>To address this, we&#8217;re introducing a set of new contribution opportunities to expand our usability testing program. As with development and graphic design, we&#8217;re going to create an infrastructure to allow community participation in usability testing on a regular basis and in a much broader capacity than existed before, when it was limited to announcements that we needed participants in <em>x</em> city on <em>y</em> date. We&#8217;ll be looking for volunteer moderators as well as participants, hopefully from all over the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderators.</strong> Observational usability testing isn&#8217;t rocket science, but neither is it a simple task to reduce bias. Because of this, at first we&#8217;ll choose only moderators who have professional experience conducting usability tests. People who conduct testing for design agencies, software companies, usability consulting firms and the like will be our first round draft picks. In the future, when we have a group of regular volunteers and have ironed out any kinks in the process, we&#8217;ll ideally match up experienced testers with aspiring ones, using a mentorship model to increase the number of people who can contribute in this fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants.</strong> If you use WordPress, chances are you could participant in a usability test at some point. In some cases we&#8217;re looking for particular behaviors (people who upload large video files, people who blog from their iPhone, people who manage more than 5 blogs, etc.), while other times the behaviors we&#8217;re looking for are much more common (do you have widgets in your sidebar, have you changed themes in the last 6 months, is there more than one author on your blog, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>So how will these opportunities come into play, and how will it make WordPress better?</strong></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll start with the moderators, and try to get volunteers with a decent geographic spread. Then, we&#8217;ll start signing up potential test participants in those areas (though we&#8217;ll also allow at-large registrations, since traveling testing will still be happening). We&#8217;re working on a registration process for potential participants. You&#8217;ll enter your basic info (location, contact info) and answer some questions about your WordPress usage to be entered in the database, and when there&#8217;s a testing opportunity coming up that&#8217;s appropriate for you, a local moderator will get in touch to see if you&#8217;re interested. Further down the road we may experiment with remote testing and other methods, but for now, this approach will broaden the geographic scope of our testing.</p>\n<p>All moderators will follow the same test protocols and script, and their results/reports/video will be reviewed and collated, with a composite report (including the protocol/script that was used) published to the community.

Abso-freakin-lutely! Take a look at the following graph. It shows the pageviews and unique visitors on this blog from mobile browsers since we started tracking last year. Notice the numbers and the trends? How many of your visitors, do you think, come back to your blog after your page takes five minutes to load on their iPhone, and needs the twenty flick, carpal thumb scroll to read browse through the huge header? If you care about your reader and want to keep up with this growing populations&#8217; reading habits, a mobile plugin on your blog is a necessity.

We also fixed over 790 bugs. This release is named in honor of noted trumpeter and vocalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Baker\">Chet Baker</a>. Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything in the new release:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll notice is that visually 2.8 feels a lot like 2.7, just with some minor tweaks here and there. However once you&#8217;ll dig in you&#8217;ll begin to appreciate the changes.</p>\n<h3>Major New Improvements</h3>\n<p>First and foremost, <strong>2.8 is way faster to use</strong>. We&#8217;ve changed the way WordPress does style and scripting.</p>\n<p>The core and plugin updaters in previous versions of WordPress have been such a success we decided to bring the same to themes. You can now <strong>browse the entire theme directory and install a theme with one click</strong> from the comfort of your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p>If you make edits or tweaks to themes or plugins from your dashboard, you&#8217;ll appreciate the new <strong>CodePress editor</strong> which gives syntax highlighting to the previously-plain editor. Also there is now contextual documentation for the functions in the file you&#8217;re editing linked right below the editor.</p>\n<p>If you were ever frustrated with widgets before, this release should be your savior. <strong>We&#8217;ve completely redesigned the widgets interface</strong> (which we didn&#8217;t have time to in 2.7) to allow you to do things like edit widgets on the fly, have multiple copies of the same widget, drag and drop widgets between sidebars, and save inactive widgets so you don&#8217;t lose all their settings. Developers now have access to a <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets_Api\">much cleaner and robust API</a> for creating widgets as well.</p>\n<p>Finally you should explore the <strong>new Screen Options on every page</strong>. It&#8217;s the tab in the top right. Now, for example, if you have a wide monitor you could set up your dashboard to have four columns of widgets instead of the two it has by default. On other pages you can change how many items show per page.</p>\n<h3>And Even More</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.8\">You can read the full list of over 180 new features, changes, upgrades, and improvements on the Codex</a>.

We also fixed over 790 bugs. This release is named in honor of noted trumpeter and vocalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Baker\">Chet Baker</a>. Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything in the new release:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll notice is that visually 2.8 feels a lot like 2.7, just with some minor tweaks here and there. However once you&#8217;ll dig in you&#8217;ll begin to appreciate the changes.</p>\n<h3>Major New Improvements</h3>\n<p>First and foremost, <strong>2.8 is way faster to use</strong>. We&#8217;ve changed the way WordPress does style and scripting.</p>\n<p>The core and plugin updaters in previous versions of WordPress have been such a success we decided to bring the same to themes. You can now <strong>browse the entire theme directory and install a theme with one click</strong> from the comfort of your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p>If you make edits or tweaks to themes or plugins from your dashboard, you&#8217;ll appreciate the new <strong>CodePress editor</strong> which gives syntax highlighting to the previously-plain editor. Also there is now contextual documentation for the functions in the file you&#8217;re editing linked right below the editor.</p>\n<p>If you were ever frustrated with widgets before, this release should be your savior. <strong>We&#8217;ve completely redesigned the widgets interface</strong> (which we didn&#8217;t have time to in 2.7) to allow you to do things like edit widgets on the fly, have multiple copies of the same widget, drag and drop widgets between sidebars, and save inactive widgets so you don&#8217;t lose all their settings. Developers now have access to a <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets_Api\">much cleaner and robust API</a> for creating widgets as well.</p>\n<p>Finally you should explore the <strong>new Screen Options on every page</strong>. It&#8217;s the tab in the top right. Now, for example, if you have a wide monitor you could set up your dashboard to have four columns of widgets instead of the two it has by default. On other pages you can change how many items show per page.</p>\n<h3>And Even More</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.8\">You can read the full list of over 180 new features, changes, upgrades, and improvements on the Codex</a>. The list is exhausting!</p>\n<h3>The Future</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re already thinking hard about the next versions, 2.9 and 3.0. Keep an eye out for improved media handling, better dependency checking, versioning of templates and themes, and of course the fabled merging of WordPress and MU announced at WordCamp San Francisco two weeks ago.</p>\";}i:11;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:40:\"bbPress: bbPress 1.0 Release Candidate 2\";s:4:\"guid\";s:25:\"http://bbpress.org/?p=234\";s:4:\"link\";s:62:\"http://bbpress.org/blog/2009/06/bbpress-1-release-candidate-2/\";s:11:\"description\";s:1641:\"<p>Today we are releasing what will be the final release candidate for bbPress 1.0 before it goes to 1.0 final in a couple of days.</p>\n<p>The release is available now from the <a href=\"http://bbpress.org/download/\">downloads page</a>.</p>\n<p>This release incorporates many bug fixes to BackPress via the final work in the lead up to the release of WordPress 2.8</p>\n<p>It also has a surprise in the form of the groundwork for a new admin interface which borrows its look and feel from WordPress.

I&#8217;ve been listening to a couple of WordPress podcasts recently (<a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly\">WordPress Weekly</a> and <a href=\"http://wordcastpodcast.com/\">WordCast</a>, in particular), and there had been a lot of buzz about some of the <a href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp</a> gatherings taking place in various locations.</p>\n<p>In particular, there were a few complaints that were pointed out (and some kudos, as well), and it got me thinking about things that event organizers might want to plan ahead for when getting ready for future WordCamps. Having been a speaker at <a href=\"http://birmingham.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Birmingham</a> last year (and planning to do it again this fall), I&#8217;m pleased to say that <a href=\"http://dresramblings.com/\">Andre Natta</a> and his cohorts did an excellent job with that event. Some of that was probably made easier by the fact that it was a relatively small WordCamp (I think it was about 60 attendees). The bigger the group, the harder the logistics.</p>\n<p>In addtition to WordCamp, I&#8217;ve also attended a couple of other technical gatherings, like CodeCamp and SoCon, so some of  what I&#8217;ll speak to are from first-hand experience. That said, what are some of the areas that an organizer should give particular attention to? Here is my completely unsolicited, backseat-driver&#8217;s list of event organizer dos and don&#8217;ts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WiFi and Bandwidth</strong>: Poor internet connectivity is probably one of the most frequent complaints heard at just about any technical conference. Try to do whatever possible to ensure that you have enough bandwidth to handle your group size. If there are special setup/login instructions, make sure you provide that information to every attendee when they check in. It&#8217;s frustrating to spend the first couple of sessions trying to figure out how to get online.</li>\n<li><strong>Streaming</strong>: If you can, identify and designate just one or two people ahead of time to handle live video/audio streaming (and perhaps a backup person). Gently remind attendees that if several people are uplinking to <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/\">ustream</a> simultaneously, it&#8217;s going to kill the network connection for everybody. Also, try to reserve good seats for those handling the videography.</li>\n<li><strong>A/C Power Outlets</strong>: Just about everybody there is going to have a laptop, and will need to charge their battery at some point. If it can be arranged, ensure that there are power outlets available. You might want to procure a bunch of extension cords and multi-outlet power strips. If outlets are in short supply, try to encourage people not to &#8220;camp&#8221; on them for the whole event, and to let others have access. Label your cords so that folks know that they belong to you, and are less likely to wander off with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Food</strong>: Be prepared to offer lunch, coffee, soft drinks, water, and maybe snacks. Try to find a sponsor for the event who can provide these things. At WordCamp Birmingham 2008, Microsoft sponsored lunch, arranging a catered buffet with salad, cole slaw, and BBQ sandwiches from a local restaurant. However, I&#8217;ll also suggest that you try to have an option suitable for vegetarians, too (something more substantial than an iceberg lettuce salad).</li>\n<li><strong>Hashtags</strong>: Decide ahead of time what the &#8220;official&#8221; hashtag for your event should be, make it known, and encourage attendees to use that. Keep it as short as possible while remaining unambiguous. I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve seen somebody on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a> saying &#8220;What&#8217;s the hashtag for the Dallas XYZ Conference? Is it #xyzconf, #xyz09, #xyzconf09, #dallasxyz, #xyzdfw09, or what?&#8221; Also, remind folks to use the hashtag when uploading photos to <a href=\"http://flickr.com/\">Flickr</a>, and while you&#8217;re at it, go ahead and set up a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/\">Flickr Group</a> for everyone to submit their photos to.</li>\n<li><strong>Adapters</strong>: You are going to have speakers with various types of computers that need to hook into your projection system. Not everybody has a standard 15-pin VGA output &#8212; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface\">DVI</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_dvi\">mini-DVI</a> connectors are also pretty common. Let them know what kind of connector your projector can hook up to, and make sure that they either have an appropriate adapter to bring with them, or that you have one, or that you can transfer their presentation someplace where you can access it. <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\">Slideshare</a> is a great resource to be familiar with. Encourage your speakers to upload and test their presentations with Slideshare, if feasible. Also make sure you have a couple of <acronym title=\"Universal Serial Bus\"><span class=\"caps\">USB</span></acronym> jumpdrives handy, for quick, last-minute file transfers.</li>\n<li><strong>Bigger Is Not Always Better</strong>: As I mentioned before, the logistics get more complicated as your group gets bigger. Big groups are great in some ways, but don&#8217;t feel obligated to accomodate a huge group if you aren&#8217;t sure you can arrange enough resources to handle them. Better to have a smaller, happy crowd, than a large angry mob (c.f., bandwidth, food). In particular, finding a low-cost location to host an event is going to be harder in proportion to the size of your group. But if you can definitely handle a big group, go for it!</li>\n<li><strong>Diversify Topics</strong>: At WordCamp Birmingham last year, we had a couple of speakers who didn&#8217;t really discuss WordPress at all. One of them spoke about freelance writing, and another spoke about how her doctor introduced her to &#8220;cancer blogging&#8221;. I found these talks to be just as engaging as anything else we heard. Also, for technical subjects, try to have topics that cover begining, intermediate, and advanced skill levels. In particular, one of the podcasts mentioned above complained about the lack of intermediate-level talks. Lastly, don&#8217;t allow too many &#8220;marketing&#8221; talks. Nobody wants to sit through what amounts to an hour-long infomercial.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Time</strong>: Make sure you allow some free time for people to socialize and network. Another complaint I heard was about an event where there was a video presentation <em>during</em> the luncheon. The attendees were frustrated that they felt obligated to listen to the presentation, when what they <em>wanted</em> to do was to talk amongst themselves. Also schedule short mid-morning and mid-afternoon breaks, if possible (don&#8217;t forget that everybody is drinking water, coffee, and soda).</li>\n<li><strong>Schwag</strong>: Even if everything else about your event is successful, people will probably think it was a little bit lame if you don&#8217;t have some sort of schwag (freebie items). For WordCamps, I believe that <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> helps out with this a little. But don&#8217;t forget to hit up your sponsors, too. They should be happy to provide some logoed stickers, t-shirts, &#8220;stress balls&#8221;, pens, fridge magnets, or whatever. Also see if you can get a few &#8220;big ticket&#8221; items to raffle off at the end of your event. Books, software, hard drives, desk toys, and such make great raffle items. If one of your presenters has authored a book, hit them up for some autographed copies!</li>\n<li><strong>Thank Your Sponsors</strong>: Make a point to thank your sponsors before, during, and after your event. Point out to the attendees things like, &#8220;it&#8217;s time to enjoy a great catered buffet lunch from Joe&#8217;s Eatery, provided by our generous sponsor, FooCorp!&#8221; Or, &#8220;remember, our bandwidth is generously provided by Own-U-Net!&#8221; (keep in mind that all sponsors are generous).</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage Your Network</strong>: Personally, I would have no idea where to start with organizing an event. But I know people who do. I&#8217;d ask them for whatever help and advice I could get. And don&#8217;t be afraid to think outside the box. Tech companies aren&#8217;t the only ones interested in sponsorships. Try restaurants, bookstores, local business entrepreneurship groups, colleges, radio and television stations, ad agencies, etc. And don&#8217;t be afraid to think big: as I mentioned before, WordCamp Birmingham had <a href=\"http://microsoft.com/\">Microsoft</a> as a sponsor (thanks for the BBQ, guys).</li>\n<li><strong>Plan Ahead</strong>: Don&#8217;t let your excitement over setting up an event trick you into committing to a date before you&#8217;re ready. I really don&#8217;t know a good guideline, but I would think that you probably need <em>at least</em> 3 months lead-time, and 4 would probably be better. I know I&#8217;ve seen a couple of events announced, then canceled, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that insufficient set-up time was part of the problem. Also, when you get close to nailing down the official date, you might want to see if there are other local or regional events that might conflict with your planned date.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There it is, my armchair-quarterback advice for organizing a conference. Take it with a big chunk of kosher salt, because I&#8217;ve never organized anything like this myself. But as a speaker and attendee, I&#8217;ve seen conferences that were well run, and some that were&#8230; not so well run. Obviously, you want to be in the former category. Out of all of this, <strong>you probably need to consider Bandwidth, Power, and Food to be your Holy Trinity</strong>. Handle those three things well, and everything else will go more smoothly.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve organized or attended a WordCamp or other technical conference, what other advice would <em>you</em> give?</p>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Jun 2009 15:30:41 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:6:\"Dougal\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:10562:\"<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1150\" title=\"WordPress Wednesday\" src=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wordpress-wednesday.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2009/06/01/whats-the-buzz\">already posted about the WordPress 2.8 release</a>, and there will be plenty of other posts highlighting everybody&#8217;s favorite new features when it officially drops, so how about if I talk about something a little different?

Participate when you have something useful to say, or an interesting question/problem to pose to other WP developers. Dive in at <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">the WP support forums</a>. Find someone with an interesting problem, and solve it for them. If it&#8217;s a notable issue, write a blog post about how to solve the issue. Which brings me to the next task&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Blog about WordPress</h3>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m doing this right now!</strong> Not only is it deliciously &#8220;meta,&#8221; it can raise your profile and help you connect with other WordPress developers and users. Write about a problem you solved, or a challenge you&#8217;d like to see addressed by WordPress core or a WordPress plugin. And don&#8217;t forget to blog about the plugins you write&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Write a bunch of useful plugins</h3>\n<p>This is probably the best thing you can do to get noticed by clients. Write a useful plugin and you&#8217;ll be getting business leads for years to come. You don&#8217;t have to write a really big, complicated plugin. Write something that will make using WordPress easier, more fun, more efficient, and people will remember you. It might be good to have one more ambitious plugin to serve as an example of your skills, but certainly don&#8217;t shy away from brevity. Some of the favorite things I&#8217;ve written are between 1 and 50 lines of code. Users don&#8217;t care about how big a plugin is. They just want it to serve a need. Go ahead and scratch their itch. Hint: monitor Google or Twitter for people saying &#8220;I want a WordPress plugin&#8230;&#8221; to get an idea of the sorts of needs that are currently unfulfilled.</p>\n<h3>Contribute to WordPress core</h3>\n<p>Contributing to the WordPress core software helps you in two ways. First, it provides continuing education. WordPress is constantly evolving, and you need to stay sharp! This is a great way to learn about (and influence) the direction of the WordPress codebase. Second, it raises your profile in the WordPress community (both the developer and user communities). Be sure to blog about your WordPress core contributions. <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">Trac</a> is a great place to start. Maintain a calm demeanor, and don&#8217;t get too big for your britches. Don&#8217;t be the person who comes in and embarrasses themselves by closing a ticket as &#8220;WONTFIX&#8221; that was opened by a seasoned developer! Watch how other tickets evolve and you&#8217;ll figure out how it works.</p>\n<h3>Stay in contact with more seasoned developers</h3>\n<p>A lot of us are busy, but we try to make time to mentor people. We&#8217;re all well-served by a vibrant development marketplace. Don&#8217;t be afraid to contact a more experienced developer for advice.

And if you haven&#8217;t, and you think you could bring something special to the event, go ahead and ask if they need any more speakers! This will raise your profile further, introduce you to really cool people, and provide you with a bunch of business leads. BarCamps, social media gatherings, and other such events are also worth attending. The point isn&#8217;t to get up there and give a business pitch. In fact, your life might be in danger if you pull that stunt at a BarCamp. The point is to impart knowledge, connect with people, while letting your skills expose themselves naturally. And pitch away when you&#8217;re chatting up potential leads between sessions.</p>\n<h3>Charge according to your skill set and experience</h3>\n<p>Several years ago, I had the quasi-embarrassing surprise of being given a voluntary 75% per-hour raise by a client. I think they were afraid that my skills had outpaced my rate, and that I was going to get wooed away by a new client at a higher rate. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of charging too little. In fact, publish higher rates than you actually think you&#8217;re worth, and allow people to haggle you down (a little). And every time you get booked up and have to turn away business, raise your rate. If you&#8217;re in that much demand, you&#8217;re not charging enough.</p>\n<h3>Find a niche</h3>\n<p>But not WordPress security.

I&#8217;m new here. I work for <a href=\"http://www.clearinteractive.com.au\">Clear Interactive</a>. I live in Melbourne, Australia. I love great user experiences. I&#8217;m here to <a href=\"http://iphone.forums.wordpress.org/forum/requests-and-feedback\">listen</a>. I&#8217;ve brought some friends with me as well.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been talking with Automattic for some time now about the WordPress for iPhone application. About the project, the community and the passion behind it. We want the WordPress for iPhone application to be the best mobile blogging tool on the iPhone.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to invite you into the thought process currently going on inside our collective heads.</p>\n<h2>Thinking Out Loud</h2>\n<p>First impressions count, it&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to focus on right now. When you open WordPress for the first time you&#8217;re greeted with this screen:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-369\" title=\"home screen\" src=\"http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/home-screen.png?w=320&#038;h=480\" alt=\"home screen\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>You have two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> &#8220;Set up your blog&#8221;</li>\n<li> &#8220;About WordPress for iPhone&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The second option is interesting, but I&#8217;m not sure why it gets equal billing on the home screen when all anyone wants to do the first time they open the application is to set up their blog.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Add Blog&#8221; screen should be shown by default if you haven&#8217;t already added one:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-368\" title=\"add a blog\" src=\"http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/add-a-blog.png?w=320&#038;h=480\" alt=\"add a blog\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Speaking of which, the cursor should already be placed in the &#8220;Blog URL&#8221; field and the keyboard should be displayed. There shouldn&#8217;t be an option to cancel as the application is unusable without at least one blog present.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Save&#8221; button should be disabled until the &#8220;Blog URL&#8221;, &#8220;User Name&#8221; and &#8220;Password&#8221; fields have been filled in. They keyboards return key should say &#8220;Next&#8221; instead of &#8220;Done&#8221;, it should jump into the next field I need to fill in.</p>\n<p>It should change to &#8220;Done&#8221; only when I&#8217;ve entered all the required fields. At the same time the &#8220;Save&#8221; button should become enabled. In fact the &#8220;Save&#8221; button should probably read &#8220;Done&#8221; as well. Something like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-371\" title=\"saving\" src=\"http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/saving.png?w=320&#038;h=480\" alt=\"saving\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>When I&#8217;m done, I want useful feedback. Currently there is a spinning icon in the top right hand corner where the &#8220;Save&#8221; button used to be. But the keyboard is still present unless I hid it while entering my details. For all intents and purposes this screen still looks like it&#8217;s in an editable state. Except the application doesn&#8217;t respond at all!  As a user, I require a clear indication of what is happening, otherwise confusion ensues, so we&#8217;ll fix that too.</p>\n<p>After I click &#8220;Done&#8221; I&#8217;m back on the home screen. Why is that? Rather than adding another blog, it seems much more likely to us that you&#8217;ll want to start using the app to manage the blog you just added, so we&#8217;ll show the &#8220;Posts/Pages/Comments&#8221; screen instead.  You can add the rest of your blogs later.</p>\n<h3>Moving Forward</h3>\n<p>As you can see we&#8217;ve been doing a lot of thinking, scrutinising and playing with ideas. We&#8217;ve already started adding these changes to the <a href=\"http://iphone.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/\">Subversion repository</a> in the user-interface-rewrite branch.</p>\n<p>They say you need to walk before you can run, let alone fly. Right now we&#8217;re still crawling, but here&#8217;s a sneak peak into the changes that we&#8217;ve got planned for the future:</p>\n<h3>User Interface Overhaul</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Home Screen</li>\n<li>Adding a Blog</li>\n<li>Editing a Blog</li>\n<li>Removing a Blog</li>\n<li>Change blog screen to use tab-bar navigation</li>\n<li>Changing the way local drafts work and are represented</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Comment Moderation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Activity Dashboard &#8211; Stream of consciousness for activity on a given blog</li>\n<li>Ability to quickly approve/delete/mark as spam</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Statefulness</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Remember which blog I was working in. Go back to that blog when I restart the application</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>We&#8217;re Listening</h3>\n<p>While we&#8217;ve singled out these changes for the future, there&#8217;s every likelihood that you have other ideas. So while we&#8217;re thinking out loud, we would love for you to do the same. Add a comment, or post to the <a href=\"http://iphone.forums.wordpress.org/\">forums</a>.

We&#8217;ve already started adding these changes to the <a href=\"http://iphone.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/\">Subversion repository</a> in the user-interface-rewrite branch.</p>\n<p>They say you need to walk before you can run, let alone fly. Right now we&#8217;re still crawling, but here&#8217;s a sneak peak into the changes that we&#8217;ve got planned for the future:</p>\n<h3>User Interface Overhaul</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Home Screen</li>\n<li>Adding a Blog</li>\n<li>Editing a Blog</li>\n<li>Removing a Blog</li>\n<li>Change blog screen to use tab-bar navigation</li>\n<li>Changing the way local drafts work and are represented</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Comment Moderation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Activity Dashboard &#8211; Stream of consciousness for activity on a given blog</li>\n<li>Ability to quickly approve/delete/mark as spam</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Statefulness</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Remember which blog I was working in. Go back to that blog when I restart the application</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>We&#8217;re Listening</h3>\n<p>While we&#8217;ve singled out these changes for the future, there&#8217;s every likelihood that you have other ideas. So while we&#8217;re thinking out loud, we would love for you to do the same. Add a comment, or post to the <a href=\"http://iphone.forums.wordpress.org/\">forums</a>. We&#8217;re listening!</p>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wpiphone.wordpress.com/357/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wpiphone.wordpress.com/357/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/wpiphone.wordpress.com/357/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/wpiphone.wordpress.com/357/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/wpiphone.wordpress.com/357/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/wpiphone.wordpress.com/357/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/wpiphone.wordpress.com/357/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/wpiphone.wordpress.com/357/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/wpiphone.wordpress.com/357/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/wpiphone.wordpress.com/357/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=iphone.wordpress.org&blog=3882653&post=357&subd=wpiphone&ref=&feed=1\" /></div>\";}i:38;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:59:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases for 05/31\";s:4:\"guid\";s:40:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=5945\";s:4:\"link\";s:87:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/05/31/wordpress-theme-releases-for-0531/\";s:11:\"description\";s:1738:\"<h4><a href=\"http://www.beepthegeek.com/2009/05/vista84-my-first-wordpress-template.html\">Vista84</a></h4>\n<p><img title=\"vista84\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/vista84.png\" alt=\"vista84\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" /></p>\n<p>3 column, widget ready, adsense friendly template with space for a 468&#215;60 banner targeted at technology blogs</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/garland-revisited\">Garland Revisited</a></h4>\n<p><img title=\"Garland Revisited\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/garlandrevisited.png\" alt=\"Garland Revisited\" width=\"200\" height=\"167\" /></p>\n<p>A flexible, three-column theme with customizable colors.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://izandi.net/2009/05/wpblue-3-column-adsense-wordpress-themes\">WPBlue</a></h4>\n<p><img title=\"wpblue\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/wpblue.jpg\" alt=\"wpblue\" width=\"200\" height=\"194\" /></p>\n<p>3 column, gravatar ready theme with two widget ready sidebars,</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://www.webdesignlessons.com/redtime-wordpress-theme/\">RedTime</a></h4>\n<p><img title=\"RedTime\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/redtime.gif\" alt=\"RedTime\" width=\"200\" height=\"176\" /></p>\n<p>The theme is in magazine style and features an absolutely massive “Twitter FollowMe” icon, which is not only extremely attractive but quite useful too.</p>\n<p>Are you a theme author?

And don&#8217;t subscribe &#8212; I put in a lowball prediction in the internal betting pool for how many subscribers there are in the first week, and I think I&#8217;m going to lose. <img src=\"http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/301/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/301/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/301/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/301/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/301/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/301/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/301/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/301/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/301/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/301/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=301&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1\" /></div>\";}i:47;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:35:\"Alex King: WordCamp SF This Weekend\";s:4:\"guid\";s:60:\"http://alexking.org/blog/2009/05/28/wordcamp-sf-this-weekend\";s:4:\"link\";s:60:\"http://alexking.org/blog/2009/05/28/wordcamp-sf-this-weekend\";s:11:\"description\";s:1137:\"<p>Along with a bunch of other folks from the <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com\">Crowd Favorite</a> team, I&#8217;ll be in San Francisco this weekend for <a href=\"http://2009.sf.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"external\">WordCamp SF</a>.

I&#8217;ll be there, so be sure and find me for a hug.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s part of the joy and difference between a WordPress event and other social tech events. WordPressers serve up hugs, not just hand shakes. What I hear over and over again at these events is how we all <em>know</em> each other, so meeting face to face is just another step in the relationship process that began a few months to a few years ago. We&#8217;re already friends!</p>\n<p>This year so far it has been my honor to be included and speaking at a variety of WordCamp events including <a title=\"WordCamp Las Vegas\" href=\"http://lasvegaswordcamp.com/\">WordCamp Las Vegas</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Whistler 2009\" href=\"http://wordcampwhistler.com/\">WordCamp Whistler</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Toronto\" href=\"http://phug.ca/wordcamptoronto\">WordCamp Toronto</a>, and <a title=\"WordCamp Columbus\" href=\"http://www.wordcampcolumbus.com/\">WordCamp Columbus</a>, and you will probably find me rattling around <a title=\"WordCamp Dallas\" href=\"http://dallas.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Dallas</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Portland\" href=\"http://www.wordcampportland.com/\">WordCamp Portland</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Seattle\" href=\"http://www.wordcampseattle.org/\">WordCamp Seattle</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp NL\" href=\"http://wordcampnl.org/\">Netherlands &#8211; WordCamp NL</a>, WordCamp Israel, and WordCamp/Podcamp Hawaii.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49341.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49341.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"img_49341 - WordCamp Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" title=\"img_49341 - WordCamp Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3742\" /></a>According to the <a title=\"WordPress Meetup Groups\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/\">WordPress Meetup Groups</a> on Meetup.com, there are 32 Meetup Groups focused specifically on WordPress, representing 3,394 Members in 5 different countries among 32 Meetup groups in 28 different cities.

You can <a title=\"browse all cities\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/\">browse a list of cities hosting WordPress events</a> or go directly to your region to find out where one is or who might be interested in putting one together.</p>\n<h3>What is the Difference Between a WordPress Meetup and WordCamp?</h3>\n<p>A WordPress Meetup is a frequent meeting of WordPress fans. If you would like to start a WordPress Meetup group, find a meeting place and announce it among your friends, and add a listing to the <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a> and <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a> and tag them &#8220;WordPress Events&#8221; and &#8220;WordPress&#8221;, as many track WordPress event announcements there.</p>\n<p>A WordPress Meetup allows locals to get together and learn from each other on how to use WordPress. There are formal WordPress meetups and informal ones, covering nothing but WordPress or including WordPress as part of other topics on web publishing and social media. WordPress meetups are usually held monthly or quarterly. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49361.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49361.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"img_49361 - WordPress Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" title=\"img_49361 - WordPress Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3744\" /></a>A WordCamp is a day or two long event with sponsors and dozens if not hundreds of WordPress fans gathering annually. WordCamp Toronto was the first, I believe, to have a three day WordCamp event, but there are no rules. It differs from a WordPress Meetup because it is offered rarely instead of regularly.</p>\n<p>WordCamps were originally formatted on the Barcamp structure, loosely put together, grassroots gatherings of WordPress fans in a day long unconference style. While this works for some communities familiar with the unconference style, some stick with a more traditional conference format. </p>\n<p>While a WordPress Meetup can cover any topics of interest to their members, a WordCamp event is focused on WordPress for the majority of the programs and workshops.</p>\n<p>Many distinguish the two events based upon the length and speakers. WordPress Meetups tend to last a few hours where WordCamps are day long events. The speakers at WordCamps can come from your region or around the world. </p>\n<h3>How Do I Start a WordCamp or WordPress Meetup?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/cali-neal-talk.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/cali-neal-talk.jpg?w=300&#038;h=189\" alt=\"Cali and Neal talk about Video blogging with WordPress at WordCamp Dallas\" title=\"Cali and Neal talk about Video blogging with WordPress at WordCamp Dallas\" width=\"300\" height=\"189\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2458\" /></a>If you would like to sponsor or host a WordCamp, check out the new official site for tracking WordCamps is <a title=\"WordCamp Central\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Central</a>, which includes instructions and <a title=\"run your own WordCamp\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/guidelines/\">guidelines for running a WordCamp</a>. There are also articles with tips and techniques for WordPress Meetups and WordCamps on <a title=\"The WordCamp Report\" href=\"http://wordcamp.info/\">The WordCamp Report</a>, as well as on blogs by those who have run these events.</p>\n<p>In general, you need to have a team of at least 5 active volunteers, a location and date, speakers, sponsors, and food or easy access to food. The rest of it is up to you.</p>\n<p>Get a free blog on <a title=\"WordPress.com free blogs\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> or host your own for the WordCamp, until WordCamp Central finishes setting up their WordPressMU blog network. Get a Twitter account and add a listing to the <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a> and <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a> and tag them &#8220;WordPress Events&#8221; and &#8220;WordCamp. These are tracked by many WordPress fans around the world, many whom are willing to fly in to the various WordPress and WordCamp events.</p>\n<h3>How Do I Get WordPress Rock Stars to My WordPress Event?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/mattm-johnp.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/mattm-johnp.jpg?w=245&#038;h=300\" alt=\"John Pozadzides and Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp Dallas\" title=\"John Pozadzides and Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp Dallas\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2475\" /></a>While <a title=\"Matt Mullenweg\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, myself, and other representatives of WordPress and <a title=\"Automattic - parent company of WordPress, WordPress.com, Akismet, BuddyPress, and more\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> try to get to as many WordCamp and WordPress events as we can, look to your own neighborhood and community for your own WordPress experts and rock stars.</p>\n<p>Many think it helps to have a &#8220;big name&#8221; to help attract attendees. In some large cities it does, but promote the event as a chance to learn about how to use WordPress in your business or personal life, and you&#8217;d be stunned at the number of people who will show up, just because they love WordPress.</p>\n<p>To ask one of the press-o-rati, contact them through their blogs, email or Twitter accounts. To request someone officially from Automattic or WordPress, use the <a title=\"Contact Us\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/contact-us/\">WordCamp Central contact form</a> and ask. You can be vague and invite whoever is willing to come, or be specific and request someone who is an expert in WordPress Themes, Plugins, BuddyPress, bbPress, PollDaddy, Intense Debate, or any of the other WordPress and Automattic specific features and services.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend you make your WordCamp and WordPress event about your community. WordCamp/Podcamp Hawaii brought in local social media experts, musicians, and tourist industry representatives familiar with WordPress to speak to attendees, giving them the local perspective that their community needs. WordCamp Toronto brought in members of the local art community to display interactive art work and held community competitions for the event logo, blog designs, and Plugins, involving as many people and groups as possible to make the event a social one. WordCamp San Francisco 2008 had a fund-raising event &#8220;Scavenger Hunt&#8221; for a local educational charity on the day after the WordCamp sessions.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of ways you can involve your community and help others blog and share their voice with the world and benefit your community in general. Make your WordPress event inclusive not exclusive</p>\n<p>To publicize your WordPress event or WordCamp, contact <a title=\"Contact Us\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/contact-us/\">WordCamp Central</a>, <a title=\"The WordCamp Report\" href=\"http://wordcamp.info/\">The WordCamp Report</a>, <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a>, <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a>, and Upcoming events tagged with &#8220;<a title=\"Upcoming: Public events tagged with \">WordCamp</a>&#8221;

Registration is closed at over 700 attendees for this one day event packed with a ton of the top blogging, social media, search engine, business, and WordPress experts. I&#8217;ll be there, so be sure and find me for a hug.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s part of the joy and difference between a WordPress event and other social tech events. WordPressers serve up hugs, not just hand shakes. What I hear over and over again at these events is how we all <em>know</em> each other, so meeting face to face is just another step in the relationship process that began a few months to a few years ago. We&#8217;re already friends!</p>\n<p>This year so far it has been my honor to be included and speaking at a variety of WordCamp events including <a title=\"WordCamp Las Vegas\" href=\"http://lasvegaswordcamp.com/\">WordCamp Las Vegas</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Whistler 2009\" href=\"http://wordcampwhistler.com/\">WordCamp Whistler</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Toronto\" href=\"http://phug.ca/wordcamptoronto\">WordCamp Toronto</a>, and <a title=\"WordCamp Columbus\" href=\"http://www.wordcampcolumbus.com/\">WordCamp Columbus</a>, and you will probably find me rattling around <a title=\"WordCamp Dallas\" href=\"http://dallas.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Dallas</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Portland\" href=\"http://www.wordcampportland.com/\">WordCamp Portland</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Seattle\" href=\"http://www.wordcampseattle.org/\">WordCamp Seattle</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp NL\" href=\"http://wordcampnl.org/\">Netherlands &#8211; WordCamp NL</a>, WordCamp Israel, and WordCamp/Podcamp Hawaii.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49341.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49341.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"img_49341 - WordCamp Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" title=\"img_49341 - WordCamp Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3742\" /></a>According to the <a title=\"WordPress Meetup Groups\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/\">WordPress Meetup Groups</a> on Meetup.com, there are 32 Meetup Groups focused specifically on WordPress, representing 3,394 Members in 5 different countries among 32 Meetup groups in 28 different cities.

are shouting out for one in their area. <a title=\"Copenhagen\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/dk/copenhagen/\">Copenhagen</a> (61 interested), <a title=\"Philadelphia, PA\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/us/pa/philadelphia/\">Philadelphia</a> (45), <a title=\"Houston, TX\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/us/tx/houston/\">Houston</a>, <a title=\"London\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/gb/london/\">London</a>, and <a title=\"Denver, CO\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/us/co/denver/\">Denver</a> are among the many. Some of these have had or are about to have a WordCamp event, so why aren&#8217;t there regular WordPress meetups?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/wordcampmeetups-map.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/wordcampmeetups-map.jpg?w=300&#038;h=263\" alt=\"WordCamp Meetups Map at Meetups.com\" title=\"WordCamp Meetups Map at Meetups.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"263\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-4101\" /></a><a title=\"WordPress Meetup Groups\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/\">WordPress Meetup Groups</a> on Meetup.com offers a map of all the places where there are WordPress events and activities and where ones are wanted. You can <a title=\"browse all cities\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/\">browse a list of cities hosting WordPress events</a> or go directly to your region to find out where one is or who might be interested in putting one together.</p>\n<h3>What is the Difference Between a WordPress Meetup and WordCamp?</h3>\n<p>A WordPress Meetup is a frequent meeting of WordPress fans. If you would like to start a WordPress Meetup group, find a meeting place and announce it among your friends, and add a listing to the <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a> and <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a> and tag them &#8220;WordPress Events&#8221; and &#8220;WordPress&#8221;, as many track WordPress event announcements there.</p>\n<p>A WordPress Meetup allows locals to get together and learn from each other on how to use WordPress. There are formal WordPress meetups and informal ones, covering nothing but WordPress or including WordPress as part of other topics on web publishing and social media. WordPress meetups are usually held monthly or quarterly. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49361.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49361.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"img_49361 - WordPress Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" title=\"img_49361 - WordPress Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3744\" /></a>A WordCamp is a day or two long event with sponsors and dozens if not hundreds of WordPress fans gathering annually. WordCamp Toronto was the first, I believe, to have a three day WordCamp event, but there are no rules. It differs from a WordPress Meetup because it is offered rarely instead of regularly.</p>\n<p>WordCamps were originally formatted on the Barcamp structure, loosely put together, grassroots gatherings of WordPress fans in a day long unconference style. While this works for some communities familiar with the unconference style, some stick with a more traditional conference format. </p>\n<p>While a WordPress Meetup can cover any topics of interest to their members, a WordCamp event is focused on WordPress for the majority of the programs and workshops.</p>\n<p>Many distinguish the two events based upon the length and speakers. WordPress Meetups tend to last a few hours where WordCamps are day long events. The speakers at WordCamps can come from your region or around the world. </p>\n<h3>How Do I Start a WordCamp or WordPress Meetup?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/cali-neal-talk.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/cali-neal-talk.jpg?w=300&#038;h=189\" alt=\"Cali and Neal talk about Video blogging with WordPress at WordCamp Dallas\" title=\"Cali and Neal talk about Video blogging with WordPress at WordCamp Dallas\" width=\"300\" height=\"189\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2458\" /></a>If you would like to sponsor or host a WordCamp, check out the new official site for tracking WordCamps is <a title=\"WordCamp Central\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Central</a>, which includes instructions and <a title=\"run your own WordCamp\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/guidelines/\">guidelines for running a WordCamp</a>. There are also articles with tips and techniques for WordPress Meetups and WordCamps on <a title=\"The WordCamp Report\" href=\"http://wordcamp.info/\">The WordCamp Report</a>, as well as on blogs by those who have run these events.</p>\n<p>In general, you need to have a team of at least 5 active volunteers, a location and date, speakers, sponsors, and food or easy access to food. The rest of it is up to you.</p>\n<p>Get a free blog on <a title=\"WordPress.com free blogs\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> or host your own for the WordCamp, until WordCamp Central finishes setting up their WordPressMU blog network. Get a Twitter account and add a listing to the <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a> and <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a> and tag them &#8220;WordPress Events&#8221; and &#8220;WordCamp. These are tracked by many WordPress fans around the world, many whom are willing to fly in to the various WordPress and WordCamp events.</p>\n<h3>How Do I Get WordPress Rock Stars to My WordPress Event?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/mattm-johnp.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/mattm-johnp.jpg?w=245&#038;h=300\" alt=\"John Pozadzides and Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp Dallas\" title=\"John Pozadzides and Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp Dallas\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2475\" /></a>While <a title=\"Matt Mullenweg\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, myself, and other representatives of WordPress and <a title=\"Automattic - parent company of WordPress, WordPress.com, Akismet, BuddyPress, and more\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> try to get to as many WordCamp and WordPress events as we can, look to your own neighborhood and community for your own WordPress experts and rock stars.</p>\n<p>Many think it helps to have a &#8220;big name&#8221; to help attract attendees. In some large cities it does, but promote the event as a chance to learn about how to use WordPress in your business or personal life, and you&#8217;d be stunned at the number of people who will show up, just because they love WordPress.</p>\n<p>To ask one of the press-o-rati, contact them through their blogs, email or Twitter accounts. To request someone officially from Automattic or WordPress, use the <a title=\"Contact Us\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/contact-us/\">WordCamp Central contact form</a> and ask. You can be vague and invite whoever is willing to come, or be specific and request someone who is an expert in WordPress Themes, Plugins, BuddyPress, bbPress, PollDaddy, Intense Debate, or any of the other WordPress and Automattic specific features and services.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend you make your WordCamp and WordPress event about your community. WordCamp/Podcamp Hawaii brought in local social media experts, musicians, and tourist industry representatives familiar with WordPress to speak to attendees, giving them the local perspective that their community needs. WordCamp Toronto brought in members of the local art community to display interactive art work and held community competitions for the event logo, blog designs, and Plugins, involving as many people and groups as possible to make the event a social one. WordCamp San Francisco 2008 had a fund-raising event &#8220;Scavenger Hunt&#8221; for a local educational charity on the day after the WordCamp sessions.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of ways you can involve your community and help others blog and share their voice with the world and benefit your community in general. Make your WordPress event inclusive not exclusive</p>\n<p>To publicize your WordPress event or WordCamp, contact <a title=\"Contact Us\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/contact-us/\">WordCamp

I spoke to Keith Winter:</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Cap Pas Cap have been in my top three for a long time now, and Not Squares were the first band in a long time to gimme the same buzz when first hearing them/you, how did you first hook up with CPC? Howd the gigging together go? Any collaborations/fun stuff in the pipeline??</em>\r\nA few of us have played with and got to know members of CPC when we were in different bands before Not Squares. When we formed last year and began looking for links to play Dublin shows we were really keen to play with them so we got in touch. Gigging together was great, we played at their 12″ launch in the Twister Pepper in December 2008. There has been serious talk about plans for a split 7″, hopefully this comes to fruition within the year! We\'re also big fans of Richter Collective bands BATS and Adebisi Shank and would love to play more shows with them in the near future. On the 12th March we are playing Twisted Pepper in Dublin and on the 12th June we\'re playing with Adebisi Shank in the Stiff Kitten on Belfast with hopefully more to be announced.\r\n\r\n<em>There\'s very developed \'scenes\' in both the North and South of Ireland, yet seemingly not much awareness of each other or collaborations. Do you agree with that? If so, why do you think this is? Is it changing? How best should we go about changing it?</em>\r\n\r\nThere have always been points of overlap between the Northern and Southern scenes but not nearly enough. Most notably, the warzone collective was a hub of punk and DIY that equally welcoming to bands from all over Ireland - this was always obvious in the line-up and attendance of Warzonefest. Since its closure there seems to be a void of communication between the two scenes; in particular Belfast and Dublin do not have an obvious cultural exchange, they are so physically close yet in people\'s minds still so divided/separated. I think it\'s an attitude which has come from top down and needs to be broken bottom up. It does seem to be changing slowly with local promoters billing acts from both scenes on the same nights much more than they used to. If bands from both scenes continue to make the efforts and travel to play gigs then the feeling of hospitality and exchange will only increase. It would be encouraging to see music press and blogs, festivals and labels make large leaps to ignore the border and treat the island as one scene. The entrepreneurial spirits of self-funded promoters such as Skinny Wolves in Dublin and Ordinary Days in Belfast are two good examples who provide a strong crossover of communication between the scenes. Personally speaking, we have no problem feeling as local in Dublin as we do in Belfast and are keen to play everywhere we can in Ireland asap!\r\n\r\n<em>NME were actually on the money for once in their review of you, but then went on to say the image of \'semtex and suicide\' prevades but ultimately results in ‘utterly life affriming\' music from the North. What do you think of that assertion?</em>\r\n\r\nThat is a pretty general assertion but it\'s an understandable one when Belfast has been bearing the ‘underdog\' cross for so long. However, it does remind me of the visceral reaction people in the  north have of defending the country at any point when they feel people are verbally attacking it! It\'s quite funny but is definitely a tired old reactionary road to go down. Yes there has been a tarnished  image of the North but that is ancient history and actually has evolved it into an interesting animal. It is no longer an excuse, instead it should be an opportunity. There is a feeling of wildness and occasion in the North outside of the normal indie aspirations where we feel a new wave of emerging acts can share their exploratory music and fresh ideas in an inclusive manner, acts such as Kicks Blue, What What, JL Seagull, Girls Names and BEW to name but a few. This open community of bands is what we would promote as ‘the North\' to the rest of Ireland if we had to do such a thing. This is separate even from bands like ASIWYFA and Panama Kings who have been trailblazing an active ‘just do it\' attitude amongst a thriving indie scene. As for utterly life-affirming musical results, that is an interesting (if not a little sweeping) statement, but funnily enough it kind of describes our underlying motivation as Not Squares; our music may be inculcated with some anger, some heartache and some downright filthy crime, but it is aiming to promote positivity and affirm to others the life we feel as we make it.\r\n\r\n<em>What do you think of assertions?</em>\r\n\r\nNot big fans of assertions. Rather do than say, or ‘Say by Do\'?\r\n\r\n<em>Magazine interviews. Necessary evil, or a perk?</em>\r\nPerky. It is refreshing to be asked interesting and challenging questions like these ones that challenge us on what is important.\"','hiYA ConNEcted MaG!
